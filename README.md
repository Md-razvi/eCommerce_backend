#Ecommerce Project:

This project is a simple backend application built for an e-commerce system.
It is developed using Spring Boot and connected to a PostgreSQL database.

In this project, I created API endpoints to manage Categories and Products.
The application allows adding and retrieving products and categories through REST APIs.

This project helped me understand how backend systems work, including database integration and API development using Spring Boot.
